scoreFactory
============
I still have a lot of work to do in documenting the methods in this pacakge.

scoreFactory contains objects and methods for building and analyzing performance of logit-regression models fit using the LASSO algorithm from the glmnet package. Model building is set up to score multiple targets and fit separate models across partitions of the data.
