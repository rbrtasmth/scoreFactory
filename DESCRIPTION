Package: scoreFactory
Title: 
Description: scoreFactory contains objects and methods for building and
    analyzing performance of logit-regression models fit using the LASSO
    algorithm from the glmnet package. Model building is set up to score
    multiple targets and fit separate models across partitions of the data.
	
	I still have a lot of work to do in documenting this code (source code is well documented though!)
